# AdviseU

A web application designed to help students and advisors at Oregon State University (OSU) generate an optimal course plan for the remainder of a student's time in school. The application considers multiple factors to develop a balanced and personalized course schedule.

## Features

- **Degree Requirements**: Automatically incorporates degree-specific course requirements.
- **Course Preferences**: Tailors courses based on student preferences in areas where multiple courses could fulfill the same requirement.
- **Interests vs Ease**: Balances student interests with ease of courses to create a more customized plan.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Assesses the difficulty level of courses to ensure a balanced course load across terms.
- **Course Availability**: Accounts for when courses are typically offered, updating dynamically when courses are canceled or added.
- **Heuristic Scheduling**: Prioritizes less frequently offered or degree-required courses in the planning process.
- **Graduation Timeline**: Adapts the course plan to fit the student’s planned graduation date and availability in upcoming terms.

## Customization

The application generates multiple permutations of potential course schedules and allows users to:

- Adjust their schedule by locking in specific courses for particular terms.
- View detailed information about each course in one centralized location.

## Goals

The primary goals of the application are to:

- Provide a useful tool for students to develop their course plans proactively.
- Enable advisors to better sort courses based on a student's interests, degree, and career path.
- Support student retention, improve graduation rates, and enhance college preparedness.

## Stretch Goals

- **Replace MyDegrees**: Create a more intuitive and functional alternative to the current course planning system at OSU.
- **Minimal OSU Integration Effort**: Design the application to require minimal adjustments for integration into OSU’s existing systems.
- **Registrar Integration**: Centralize course planning and degree progress tracking by replacing or integrating with OSU’s registrar system.
- **High User Capacity**: Support many active users simultaneously, particularly during registration periods.
- **AI Academic Advisor**: Provide an AI-powered assistant that helps users choose courses based on their interests and career goals. The AI would:
  - Deliver real-time information from OSU’s systems.
  - Answer student questions, reducing the strain on academic advisors.

This project aims to create a centralized and dynamic tool that benefits both students and advisors in course planning, enhancing the academic experience and success at OSU.
